Describe-
If you are asked to describe something, 
you should state the features in such a way that another person could recognise what you are describing if they saw it. 
An example might be: ‘Describe a donkey’. 
It would be insufficient to state ‘Four legs and a back’, as this could be a chair. 
A description stating ‘A four-legged animal, long tail, mane, similar to a horse, 
but generally smaller, eats grass, hay and makes a unique sound as in eeyore or heehaw, 
often repeatedly’ would probably allow another person to recognise it as a donkey.

Define–
If you are asked to define something, 
you should describe it in such a way that a reader could follow what you are saying and arrive at the same point as you. 
It often relates to the classification of objects into groups and categories or the meaning of something.   
An example might be: ‘Define how medicines are classified’. 
The answer would include naming the different categories and then giving some examples of each category.

Explain–
Give details to make clear what you are saying in plain English. 
This requires the most in-depth answer as a general rule.

State–
Usually requires a shorter answer, which could be a list or a single sentence. 
Several questions will take the form of ‘State what the abbreviation BBC stands for’. 
The answer would be ‘British Broadcasting Corporation’.

Outline/Summarise–
Needs a brief answer which does not include much detail, but covers all steps, stages or parts involved. 
A question asking you to outline how to catch a train to York would require an answer along the lines of: ‘Check train times, 
choose a train, go to the station, buy a ticket and board the train.’  
It would not expect you to include the details of how you would check the train times, 
how you would get to the station, buy your ticket and board the train.

Identify–
Give sufficient detail so that someone else can recognise your description. 
This is sometimes used instead of ‘list’ or ‘state’ so think what the question is asking for.  

List–
Your answer should give an item-by-item record of names or things that are written one below the other.



• List or identify - write a list, like a shopping list (numbers or bullets)
• Describe - write a detailed account, like a story (not a list)
• Explain - give your answer and your reasons
• Outline - provide a few sentences together with some key points
